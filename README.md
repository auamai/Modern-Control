# Modern-Control
A course on the analytical representation of finite dimensional linear systems, analysis and design of linear feedback control systems based on the state space model, and state/output feedback. 

Lab 1 - A simulink model of a permanent magnet DC motor is built. This system is created using both the state space block in simulink, and ordinary differential equations. The system matrices have been derived by hand, and the motor parameters are provided. The system matrices are initialized in the Matlab script, and their values are used in the corresponding simulink models.
